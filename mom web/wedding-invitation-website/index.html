          <p class="text reveal">
            In the past 30+ years of working as Nursing Officer from Amar Jain
            hospital to SMS hospital, this journey was full of God's grace and
            mercy. Countless night, evening and morning duties and operations.
            Family like doctors and staff of Bangad Ward of Neurosurgery
            department, from joining to retirement supported me and was just a
            call away. Unlimited service with selflessness and gratitude for
            this lifetime opportunity. SMS YOU WILL BE MISSED, MY OT YOU WILL BE
            MISSED. As if a long period of my life is coming to an end, but
            goodbyes are never the end.
